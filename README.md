# My build of Suckless Utilities

My build of dwm, st, dmenu and slock.

If you are using my dwm make sure you have Noto Emoji font is installed and add the scripts that I have on .local/bin in artix-rice repo.

Feel free to leave any recommendation and suggestions.

## Build Dependencies
Make sure dependencies of building packages are installed.
On Arch linux install base-devel meta package.
On others install at least gcc and make to make sure it gives what libraries are missing on your system.

## Warning 
Make sure that the version of libXft is 2.3.6 or above to make sure emojis are handled properly.
